# HighLow

In main.py, create a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess what the number is. If the user's guess is too high, the program should tell them to guess lower, and if the guess is too low, the program should tell them to guess higher. The program should limit the number of guesses the user has to correctly guess the number.
